# TIL - Today I Learned

## About
At my job and during side projects, I constantly learn new things. This is my collection of them.

Props to [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) for the original idea.

## Bash

- copy the output of a command: `... | yank`
- interactively explore a folder's content: `ncdu foldername`
- filter the output of a command in a regex-like way: `... | grep -i ...` (`-i` stands for case insensitive)

## Git

## PyCharm

## Python
